    title     = {Virtual mutation analysis of relational database schemas},
    booktitle = {Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Automation of Software Test},
    year      = {2016},
    abstract  = {Relational databases are a vital component of many modern software applications. Key to the definition
                 of the database schema --- which specifies what types of data will be stored in the database and the
                 structure in which the data is to be organized --- are integrity constraints. Integrity constraints are
                 conditions that protect and preserve the consistency and validity of data in the database, preventing
                 data values that violate their rules from being admitted into database tables. They encode logic about
                 the application concerned, and like any other component of a software application, need to be properly
                 tested. Mutation analysis is a technique that has been successfully applied to integrity constraint
                 testing, seeding database schema faults of both omission and commission. Yet, as for traditional
                 mutation analysis for program testing, it is costly to perform, since the test suite under analysis
                 needs to be run against each individual mutant to establish whether or not it exposes the fault. One
                 overhead incurred by database schema mutation is the cost of communicating with the database management
                 system (DBMS). In this paper, we seek to eliminate this cost by performing mutation analysis virtually
                 on a local model of the DBMS, rather than on an actual, running instance hosting a real database. We
                 present an empirical evaluation of our virtual technique revealing that, across all of the studied
                 DBMSs and schemas, the virtual method yields an average time saving of 51% over the baseline.}
