# research-bibliography

This repository contains a BibTeX file for all of the research papers, presentations, volumes edited, supervised theses,
and supervised presentations of me, [Gregory M. Kapfhammer](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/gkapfham). You are free to
use any of the entries in this file if you are interested in citing one of these research deliverables in a LaTeX
document. This repository is used in [gkapfham/curriculum-vitae](https://github.com/gkapfham/curriculum-vitae) to
automatically create several sections of my curriculum vitae.
